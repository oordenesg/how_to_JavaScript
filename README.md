# how_to_JavaScript

JavaScript is primarily know as the languague of most modern web browsers. At the begining it had a bad reputation. However, the languague has continued to evolve and improve. In general, we can say that JS is flexible, powerful and fast programming language. Now, it has been used it a lot for complex web development and beyond.

In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in out code.  In the other hand, keywords are words that are built into the JavaScrip languague, so computers will recognize them and treats them specially.

One method that is buil into the console object is the *.log()* method. It is very useful when we want to print values to the console so we can the work that we're doing. For example, if we want to print a number

```javascript
console.log(2); // It shows how to use the keyword log() 
```
In JS there are 7 fundamental data types. Quite similar to other programming languages. Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, Object (collections of realted data). The first 6 of them are considered *primitive data types* since they are the most basic data types. This is an example of using *log* with a couple of data types.

```javascript
console.log('JavaScript');
console.log(2011);
console.log('Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy');
console.log(20.49);
```
